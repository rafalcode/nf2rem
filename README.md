# nf2rem
Standing for "New File TO REMote". THis is a shell script task, whereby a remote linux computer contacts a local Windows computer abotu a a certain folder and a possible new file in that folder.


# Rough work notes

* Some small configuration work on Windows machine may be necessary as they are not usually enabled by default for this sort of operation. In particular, a sharing folder must be designated. Its settings configuration must be revised so that secutiry and network parameters do not shut out attempts by (even) an authorised remote server to access a certain folder.
